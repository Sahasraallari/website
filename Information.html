<h2>Forest</h2>
<p>A forest is an ecosystem characterized by a dense community of trees. Hundreds of definitions of forest are used throughout the world, incorporating factors such as tree density, tree height, land use, legal standing, and ecological function.</p>

<h2 >Squirrel</h2>
<p >Squirrels typically have slender bodies with very long very bushy tails and large eyes. In general, their fur is soft and silky, though much thicker in some species than others. The coat color of squirrels is highly variable between—and often even within—species.</p>

<h2 >Bear</h2>
<p >Bears are large animals with short tails that mainly live in the Americas, Asia, and Europe. They are the largest of the carnivores, or flesh-eating land mammals. However, besides the meat-eating polar bears and the bamboo-eating panda bears, most bears are omnivorous (eating both plant and animal matter).</p>

<h2 >Deer</h2>
<p >Deer live mainly in forests but may be found in deserts, tundra, and swamps and on high mountainsides. They are native to Europe, Asia, North America, South America, and northern Africa and have been introduced widely elsewhere. Females are usually called does, and males bucks.</p>

<h2 >Panda</h2>
<p >Pandas live mainly in temperate forests high in the mountains of southwest China, where they subsist almost entirely on bamboo. They must eat around 26 to 84 pounds of it every day, depending on what part of the bamboo they are eating. They use their enlarged wrist bones that function as opposable thumbs.</p>
